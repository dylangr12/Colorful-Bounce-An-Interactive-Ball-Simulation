//The concept behind the program is to create an interactive and visually engaging simulation of a bouncing ball. The program aims to offer users a playful experience with simple controls. I chose to represent the ball with a colorful ellipse to make it visually appealing and easy to track as it moves across the canvas. The choice of colors was inspired by the desire to create a vibrant and lively atmosphere, with the ball changing colors upon collision to add more visual attraction. You may interact with the program by clicking the mouse to relocate the ball and observe its movement. The most challenging part of the project was making seemingly natural movements while handling edge collisions. To address this, I carefully managed the ball's velocity and direction upon collision, ensuring it bounced off the edges seamlessly without losing its playful charm.
